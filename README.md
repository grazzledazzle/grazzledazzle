Hi, I’m @grazzledazzle.
===========================

I'm also J.G. Hetherton, the author of a few books in the Laura Chambers mysteries series set in Hillsborough, North Carolina: LAST GIRL GONE and WHAT LIES BENEATH, which came out in July 2022. A new book meant it was time to update my website, and because I'm interested in learning a bit of coding, I've decided to build a new one myself. A static site seems like the right choice for a book or an author, and Jekyll seems like the right tool to get it done.

So that's what I'm working on right now. You can contact me at my twitter @JGHetherton or jghetherton@gmail.com
